# Catstonaut-Shooter-Game

This is a simple space-invaders style game I made in python while learning to use the graphics module pygame. The game takes place in some random galaxy where the catstronaut needs to dodge asteroids and pickup shields and powerups to extend it's health, or activate rapid fire or rockets.
