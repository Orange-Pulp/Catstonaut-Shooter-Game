# Catstonaut-Shooter-Game

This is a simple space-invaders style game I made in python using the graphics module pygame. Dodge asteroids and pickup 
shields and powerups to extend your health, or activate rapid fire or rockets.

Update, verion 1.1. I Added a loop to bring you back to the main menu when you die. This allows you to restart and  
play continuously without needing to close and re-start the game. In-game difficulty options and speed mods are hopefully soon to come!
